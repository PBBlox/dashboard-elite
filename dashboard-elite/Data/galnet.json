This organisation monitored all public and private communications for evidence of terrorists, to prevent similar attacks in future. But its highly controversial nature would soon present the Federation with new challenges.”<br>“ACT’s investigation led them to the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, which had helped deliver the caustic enzyme bombs to their nine targets. The faction’s defeat was an early victory against the NMLA, but much of the organisation remained a mystery.”<br>“When the ‘ghost ship’ Adamastor began receiving an encoded signal, this began an entire saga of mysteries. Its long-lost sister ship, the Hesperus, was soon located by pilots who had been recruited by an anonymous figure named Salvation. His interest in Azimuth Biochemicals, the 200 year old corporation that owned both vessels, would bring a strange twist to the ongoing Thargoid conflict.”<br>“In May, Hadrian Duval was targeted by Federal forces after accusations that he was the mastermind behind the NMLA. The spectre of Empire-Federation war rose once again as Nova Imperium successfully defended itself, but ACT concluded that evidence had been falsified to implicate Hadrian and his new wife Lady Astrid.”<br>“Aegis came under intense scrutiny when the megaship Alexandria, laden with newly collected Guardian artefacts, began attracting Thargoids in every system it jumped to. The Alexandria later vanished completely in hyperspace, and to this day remains missing presumed destroyed.”<br>“The Alliance election finally took place at the end of May, having been delayed by three months due to the Galactic Summit. Councillor Nakato Kaine fought a spirited campaign, but Edmund Mahon was re-elected to serve a second term as prime minister.”<br>“Supporters of Neo-Marlinism gained a voice in June, when Minister Aaron Whyte offered a peace deal with the Empire to prevent further terrorism. The idea of a political wing of the NMLA gained support from those fearing further bombings, but opened major rifts within the Marlinist Colonies.”<br>“Salvation once again contacted pilots to track down survivors from the Hesperus. This led to the discovery of an ancient Guardian-Thargoid battleground, where Azimuth scientists had built a research base around their vessel Proteus. All were killed by unusual experiments into weaponising Guardian crystals.”<br>“The Proactive Detection Bureau had been generally accepted by Federal citizens, but many claimed it was a violation of civil liberties. Halfway through the year, the Azaladshu Free faction took the bold step of seceding from the Federation, thus triggering the possibility of mass rebellion.”<br><br>"},{"title":"A Retrospective of 3307 (Part One)","field_galnet_date":"28 DEC 3307","imageList":["NewsImageCoriolisGasGiantSunrise"],"field_galnet_body":"The noted historian Sima Kalhana takes a look back at the turbulent events of the last year in a four-part series of articles.<br>“The start of 3307 was a time of crisis. The rise of the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA), the Marlinist refugee crisis and increased Empire-Federation tensions had brought a full-scale superpower war closer, with renewed attacks from the Thargoids increasing the pressure.”<br>“All of this led to Pranav Antal’s proposal of a diplomatic conference for all three superpower governments to work through their problems – the very first Galactic Summit. Within weeks, Sirius Corporation was selected as the neutral host for the conference. Li Yong-Rui scored another triumph by establishing the Marlinist Colonies for millions of political refugees who had fled from the Empire.”<br>“In February came the trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent, accused of arranging Starship One’s destruction back in 3301. His paymaster was revealed as Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester, who wanted to replace Federal democracy with direct corporate rule.”<br>“His breakaway faction Jupiter Division was defeated in battle and Rochester himself jailed for life. This also led to Core Dynamics’s acquisition of Lakon Spaceways being cancelled, leaving the Alliance to purchase a majority sharehold in the company.”<br>“Key players on the political stage finally gathered when the Galactic Summit began in late February. The Sirius system hosted leaders from the Alliance, Empire, Federation and independent systems. Even pirate warlord Archon Delaine gatecrashed the event, causing controversy with his ‘crown of bones’ speech.”<br>“It seemed for a while that the bickering between so many strong personalities might trigger a war rather than avert one. But gradually there was progress, with the possibility of a treaty to increase unity against the Thargoid threat. But before reaching this conclusion, the Galactic Summit was derailed by a threat from another source.”<br>“Nine Martyrs – as named by the NMLA leader Theta Seven – was the largest terrorist attack in history. Hundreds of thousands were killed by starport bombings in nine systems, including the superpower capitals of Alioth, Achenar and Sol. This horrific tragedy ended the conference abruptly, but did give rise to some inter-power cooperation.”<br>“A new agreement signed at the Galactic Summit allowed the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit (ACT) to be formed rapidly. Drawing on the superpowers’ security services and other organisations, its sole purpose was to hunt down and eliminate the NMLA, a task that would dominate the headlines for the rest of the year.”"},{"title":"GalNet: Apology for Unauthorised Broadcasts","field_galnet_date":"27 DEC 3307","imageList":["NewsImageDiplomacyPressConference"],"field_galnet_body":"*Pilots’ Federation ALERT*<br>The GalNet editorial team expresses its sincere regret that further unscheduled messages have been recently published.<br>A second batch of riddles were unlawfully transmitted across GalNet public feeds on the 24th, 25th and 26th of December.

It is hard to imagine what they might offer him in terms of clemency, but they’re obviously determined to prevent further deaths at the NMLA’s hands.”<br>“After speaking to one of ACT’s tactical advisors, I can reveal that Captain Castile’s commando unit tried and failed to board the Sacrosanct as it did the Steel Majesty. This is apparently because the vessel is specially modified to prevent external access, in order to provide the Far God cultists with a sanctified environment during their pilgrimage.”<br>“Speaking of the cultists, they may not have accepted their predicament quite as passively as expected. Internal power failures detected within the Sacrosanct’s hyperdrive systems may well be a result of sabotage, and would explain why it hasn’t left the Mudhrid system. Perhaps in their own way, the Thargoid-worshippers are seeking justice for those murdered by Theta Seven’s appropriation of their deity’s ‘holy’ caustic enzymes.”"},{"title":"Dredger Clan Resumes Nomadic Travels","field_galnet_date":"03 DEC 3307","imageList":["NewsImageExpansionExploration"],"field_galnet_body":"*Pilots’ Federation ALERT*<br>The Scriveners Clan dredger has departed from the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system to an unknown destination.<br>Freelance reporter Casey Kilpatrick provided a report for Vox Galactica: <br>“After a coalition of supporters helped them to bypass Orion University’s override codes, the Scriveners Clan has finally resumed their nomadic lifestyle. To its credit, the university has finally taken stock of public opinion and agreed not to pursue its ownership claims over the ancient dredger.”<br>“Many in the scientific community have pointed out that the contents of the Knowledge Core, around which the Scriveners’ entire culture is based, will now remain a mystery. There are rumours that this tribe of academic researchers have acquired data about the Guardians during their decades of wandering, which was perhaps the real prize sought by Orion University.”<br>“Concerns have also been raised about the Scriveners’ chances of survival if they encounter hostile forces. Had the Scientia Aeterna megaship been allowed to accompany the dredger, it could have offered protection or at least called for assistance. Now that the Scriveners Clan have resumed a solitary existence, their fate is once again entirely in their hands.”"},{"title":"Empire Celebrates Newborn Duval","field_galnet_date":"02 DEC 3307","imageList":["NewsImageImperialPalace"],"field_galnet_body":"*Pilots’ Federation ALERT*<br>A new chapter in the Duval family’s history has begun with the birth of Hadrian Augustus Duval’s son.<br>The announcement was made by The Imperial Herald:<br>“Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval, wife of Hadrian Duval, has delivered a baby boy at an undisclosed secure location while under senatorial protection.”<br>“The child has been named Hector Mordanticus Duval.
