The station was fitted with engines, and roamed the galaxy for four decades, until it returned to inhabited space in 3301. A year later, Jaques announced his intention to execute a daring jump to the far side of the galaxy, to Beagle Point, and asked independent Commanders to help with stocking up fuel.

These historical essays are included here.\r\n\r\n**The Celestial Sphere**\r\n\r\nThe term [celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere) refers to what you see in the sky, and the relative apparent positions of astronomical objects. All objects in the sky can be imagined as though they are projected on the inside of a giant sphere.  In gaming terms, you might think of this as the \"sky box\", but it's a useful tool in astronomy. \r\n\r\nSince astronomical objects are extremely distant, for practical purposes (such as constructing star maps of the sky) they can be thought of as *infinitely* distant, with parallel sight lines from the ground. This imaginary, projected sphere would be infinitely large, with Earth at its center. While this isn't physically real, astronomers still use a set of two-dimensional coordinates to describe an object's position in the sky, namely [Right Ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension) and [declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination), and still use the term *\"celestial sphere\"* to describe this coordinate system. For a full three-dimensional description of an object's position in space relative to our solar system, a distance is also needed, but historically this has been the most difficult coordinate to measure. The 2D location within the sky, however, can be measured with great precision, and historically this has been possible for centuries. \r\n\r\nIn ancient times, there was a widespread belief that these astronomical objects were literally placed on a sphere that surrounded the Earth. There was also a belief that the planets, whose motion in the sky didn't match the more distant objects, might be objects on large, concentric, nested crystal spheres that rotate around the Earth. Planetary motion defied understanding for quite some time, as their movement in the sky often contained strange loops and squiggles, with \"retrograde\" movement. \r\n\r\nAs we continue, we'll look at the history of orbital mechanics, and the advances made by various astronomers and philosophers, from geocentric to heliocentric models of the solar system, leading to the present day.\r\n\r\n![](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/ContentFeature/OrbitsHistory/images/retrograde_mars_tezel_2007-2008.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-437079d7febe9417840354fd346bca36)\r\n\r\n**Aristotle & Ptolemy** \r\n\r\nFor most of human history, it was believed that Earth was the center of the universe. Everything in the sky seemed to rotate around us, in a giant celestial sphere. This view of the cosmos continued well after it was understood that the Earth is spherical, rather than a flat surface.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Aristotle, who is often considered the \"father of science\", believed in a geocentric system. His view of a stationary Earth at the center of a revolving universe persisted for well over a thousand years.\r\n\r\nSeveral centuries later, Ptolemy created one of the first models of the solar system that *seemed* to explain the strange retrograde motion that planets would occasionally have in the sky. He claimed to have based his geometric model on writings from other astronomers spanning over 800 years before him, such as the writings of Hipparchus, who described the motion of the moon using the concept of an [Epicycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle) to explain its variations in speed during its orbit. While epicycles were first proposed by Apollonius of Perga, Ptolemy formalized it and extended the use of epicycles to explain planetary motion, both in terms of speed variations, and the anomolous retrograde loops and squiggles that the planets would draw out against the background stars.\r\n\r\nThe epicycle (literally \"circle moving on another circle\") explained these motions by having the planets revolve on circles (or crystal spheres), that in turn would orbit the Earth in circular paths. While this model was able to predict the motion of the planets, it still lacked precision. Nevertheless, this system persisted as the dominant model for centuries, well into the medieval period. It had been a long held belief, that was further perpetuated by Christian Europe, that everything in the heavens should be perfect, and there was nothing more perfect than a true circle, and therefore the orbits must have been perfect circles.\r\n\r\n(As an interesting aside-- Ptolemy attempted to calculate the size of the universe, using his epicycle planetary model. He estimated that the Sun was at an average distance of 1,210 Earth radii, and the radius of the celestial sphere was 20,000 times the Earth's radius).\r\n\r\n![](http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/Epicycle_solaire_512px.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Aristarchus of Samos**\r\n\r\n[Aristarchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos) was considerably ahead of his time. While he preceded Ptolemy, he is among the earliest to propose a heliocentric view, in which the Earth orbits the Sun. His ideas were rejected in favor of the incorrect geocentric models of Aristotle and Ptolemy, for centuries.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately much of his writings were lost. However Archimmedes references his works and describes his heliocentric ideas. Nicolaus Copernicus, who is credited with formalizing a heliocentric view of the solar system, also credits Aristarchus as the originator of the heliocentric theory.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Aristarchus also correctly suspected that the stars were other suns, and that they were far enough away to have no observable [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax). This was unprovable at the time, since [Stellar Parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax) is only detectable with telescopes.\r\n\r\nIronically, the only surviving work attributed to Aristarchus uses geometry to calculate the size and distance to the sun and the moon, in a *geocentric* view. His calculations were incorrect due to the lack of precision in the measurements he had access to, but his geometry was sound. The descriptions from Archimedes of his other works show that he had better numbers and calculations at other times, and his surviving work isn't the best example.\r\n\r\n![](http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/Aristarchus_working.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Copernicus**\r\n\r\nNicolaus Copernicus was a mathematician and astronomer, in the Renaissance era. His book *De revolutionibus orbium coelestium* (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) brought about a revolution in science, with his *heliocentric* theory of the solar system. Interestingly, he was reluctant to publish it, despite the urging of his closest friends, because he feared the scorn that it would bring him. The dominant theory until then, was still Ptolemy's geocentric system of epicycles.\r\n\r\nAmong the revelations presented in his book were Earth's rotation on its axis, the fact that Earth is a planet like the others in the solar system, and the correct order of orbits of the planets, from the sun outward. These ideas were not widely popular when he first published his theory, but it gradually took hold in secret.\r\n\r\nHis system of *circular* orbits around the sun still had problems with accuracy, as the elliptical nature of orbits was yet to be discovered. He made corrections by retaining a set of small epicycles, which he called \"epicyclets.\" However the correct ordering of the planets naturally fell into place, as he scaled the orbits of each planet relative to the Earth's motion. While he was mostly correct, and his theory could explain the retrograde motion of the planets in the sky, it couldn't fully prove the heliocentric model until Kepler later cracked the math behind elliptical orbits, eliminating the need for epicycles altogether. In the meantime, his model was comparable in accuracy to Ptolemy's model that was still in widespread use after more than a thousand years. Copernicus offered a much simpler system that achieved comparable results.\r\n\r\n![](http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/retrograde.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Kepler & Galileo**\r\n\r\nGalileo, born approximately 100 years after Copernicus, revolutionized astronomy with the use of the telescope.  He was able to observe the phases of Venus, which is an inner planet that will never show us its fully illuminated side, which proved the heliocentric model. He also observed moons circling Jupiter. \r\n\r\nAround the same time, Johannes Kepler was working out a series of laws to describe the orbits of the planets around the sun. It took him about 10 years to complete his book, *Astronomia Nova* (A New Astronomy), before publishing it.  In his book, he outlined equations and terminology to fully describe elliptical orbits in three dimensions, all of which are still in use today.\r\n\r\nPrior to working out his theory, Kepler had worked as an assistant to the astronomer Tycho Brahe, who had collected a lifetime of astronomical observations, but kept it mostly hidden from Kepler for fear that he would use it to try to prove a Copernican heliocentric theory. When Tycho Brahe died, the collection of data passed on to Kepler, who was able to use it for completing his theory.\r\n\r\nLike those who came before him, Kepler believed that orbits should be perfect circles, but struggled to make that work with the recorded observations of Mars that Brahe had collected. Eventually he stumbled upon the fact that an imaginary line drawn from the Sun to a planet's position will sweep out an equal area of space in an equal time, regardless of which side of the orbit the planet is in, and how fast it is moving there.\r\n\r\nThis discovery, which became his second law of orbital motion, led to what became his first law: that the planets move in elliptical orbits, with the sun at one focus of the ellipse. His third law shows that there is a precise relationship between the planet's distance from the sun, and the period of the orbit (the length of time it takes to complete one orbit). \r\n\r\nKepler had tried various other orbital shapes, including an egg-shaped ovoid, to explain the equal area over equal time phenomenon. This was unsuccessful until after approximately 40 attempts, that he tried fitting it to an ellipse.  He had previously dismissed it as too simple of a solution to have been overlooked by his predecessors. Once he demonstrated that this perfectly fit the Mars data, he concluded that it must be true for all of the planets.\r\n\r\nWhat Kepler lacked though, was an understanding of *why*. He proposed that there were two forces acting upon the planets: one to propel them forward through their paths, and one to attract them toward the sun. What he didn't understand was that these were simply inertia and gravity, respectively. He did however correctly deduce that whatever solar force was acting on the planets, it must lose strength over distance, since the planets move more slowly when they're further away.\r\n\r\nWhile very precise, there are still orbital effects that can't be accounted for using his perfect elliptical equations. His system assumes a *2-body* system, with planets represented as point-masses orbiting a stationary sun. In reality, the sun orbits a barycenter that is contained within itself, and the planets interact with each other in subtle ways. This is referred to as the *N-body* problem, and it results in the orbits changing over time, in many cases oscillating in eccentricity, and perhaps also a precession of the orbit, meaning the direction of the ellipse's long axis can slowly rotate. Newtons laws of motion and universal gravitation were still decades away.\r\n\r\n(As an aside, my ship is named *Astronomia Nova*, after Kepler's book)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Aside #2:  Elite uses perfect Kepler orbits in the game.\r\n\r\n![](http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/kepler01.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/Kepler2-m-enl-m-sun-letters-512px.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Newton**\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton brought further understanding to the orbital motion of the planets, beyond the pure elliptical mathematics that Kepler described. As previously noted, Kepler didn't fully understand why the planets moved as they did, and only postulated the existence of forces acting upon them.\r\n\r\nNewton came to the conclusion that all objects in motion, whether it was the orbit of a moon or planet, or an apple falling from a tree, must follow the same principles.  Previous Aristotelian lines of thought had assigned different rules and types of motion to different things. Newton shifted the overall scientific perspective to unified patterns in nature.\r\n\r\nIn his book, *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\", often simply referred to as *Principia*, pronounced with a hard-C, and published in 1687), Newton laid the foundations of classical mechanics, and proposed that all matter exerts a gravitational force that attracts matter toward its center. The strength of this force depends on the mass of the object, and weakens with distance.\r\n\r\nIn a famous example, Newton created a thought experiment with the idea of climbing a tall mountain, above the atmosphere, and firing a cannon parallel to the ground.  He proposed that as the power of the shot increased, the cannonball would travel further with each shot, and that there would be a speed at which the trajectory of the cannonball would match the curvature of the planet, returning the shot to the point of origin. This would effectively create an orbit (diagram below).\r\n\r\nNewton's laws and equations worked so well, that they are still used today as classical mechanics, and the foundation of modern classical physics.\r\n\r\nNewton's laws of motion and universal gravitation seemed to complete the entire picture of how objects move through space, and how gravity works. But this too was incomplete. Astronomers began to notice something odd about the planet Mercury.  Even after taking into account the influences of all of the other planets in the solar system, the orbit of Mercury seemed to precess (rotate) more than it should. This anomalous effect was measurable, and could not be explained away until a new, additional theory came along.\r\n\r\n![](http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/newton-cannonball.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Precession of Perihelion of Mercury, and Einstein**\r\n\r\nNewton's laws of motion and universal gravitation stood relatively unchallenged as the best theory of gravity for over two centuries. However, during the latter part of this period, a problem was noticed.\r\n\r\nDue to interactions between the planets, their orbits can precess over time (rotation of orientation of the orbit).  Newton's laws described this very well, for the most part. However, in 1859 Urbain Le Verrier discovered that the rate of precession for the planet Mercury disagreed with the predictions from Newton's theory. This anomalous precession lacked a good explanation for decades. Though many ideas were suggested, they all failed to hold up to scrutiny.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is that Newton's theory depended on the assumption that mass, distance, and time are constant regardless of where you observe them.\r\n\r\nAlbert Einstein published his theories of Special Relativity in 1905 and General Relativity in 1915, which proposed a deeper underlying reality in which time, space, and mass are much more fluid, and depend on the frame of reference in which you measure them. Newton's theory is still mostly true within a single frame of reference, and on small scales and at low speeds where the differences from Einstein's system are negligible. However objects in orbit have independent reference frames, and Mercury is in a particularly fast orbit, deep within the sun's gravity well.\r\n\r\nThis new theory described a system in which space and time (together referred to as spacetime) can be distorted by the presence of matter and energy. Time is flexible, and runs slower in places that are deeper within gravitational fields. With the curvature of spacetime mediating the gravitation between the sun and Mercury, whose orbit is very close, the remaining anomalous precession could now be easily explained.  \r\n\r\nEinstein was aware of this problem in astronomy, and in his paper he proposed three separate tests that could be performed to prove his theory, and included Mercury's precession as one of them.  In fact, it was soon demonstrated that his theory's predictions matched very closely with observed measurements, which cemented General Relativity as something to be taken seriously, and it remains the currently accepted theory of gravity.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that only at extreme speeds or scales will Einstein's relativistic effects be noticed.  Even with Mercury's orbit, the effects were subtle, and required precise measurements to be detectable. Newton's and Kepler's mathematical models work so well within the scale of the solar system that they are still used to launch satellites and other spacecraft to destinations throughout, and predict their motion.  For this reason Einstein's theories often are not seen as a replacement, but rather a more complete realization of the same physical laws.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us full circle, to why I wanted to use a Mercury-like planet in a tight, fast orbit for my circumnavigation! ;) :D\r\n\r\nThis of course was a very superficial historical look at the development of an understanding of gravity and planetary orbits. If you're interested in more detail, there's certainly a wealth of information online about these subjects. We've only just scratched the surface, of course.\r\n\r\n![](http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/mercury-precession2.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/Relativistic_precession.jpg)\r\n\r\n**end of line**","descriptionHtml":"<p>One of a small number of planets that have been used for SRV circumnavigation of a planetary body, the first planet of this star system is a small, hot, rocky world with large amounts of open terrain.

Once he demonstrated that this perfectly fit the Mars data, he concluded that it must be true for all of the planets.</p>\n\n<p>What Kepler lacked though, was an understanding of <em>why</em>. He proposed that there were two forces acting upon the planets: one to propel them forward through their paths, and one to attract them toward the sun. What he didn't understand was that these were simply inertia and gravity, respectively. He did however correctly deduce that whatever solar force was acting on the planets, it must lose strength over distance, since the planets move more slowly when they're further away.</p>\n\n<p>While very precise, there are still orbital effects that can't be accounted for using his perfect elliptical equations. His system assumes a <em>2-body</em> system, with planets represented as point-masses orbiting a stationary sun. In reality, the sun orbits a barycenter that is contained within itself, and the planets interact with each other in subtle ways. This is referred to as the <em>N-body</em> problem, and it results in the orbits changing over time, in many cases oscillating in eccentricity, and perhaps also a precession of the orbit, meaning the direction of the ellipse's long axis can slowly rotate. Newtons laws of motion and universal gravitation were still decades away.</p>\n\n<p>(As an aside, my ship is named <em>Astronomia Nova</em>, after Kepler's book)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Aside #2:  Elite uses perfect Kepler orbits in the game.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/kepler01.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/Kepler2-m-enl-m-sun-letters-512px.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Newton</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sir Isaac Newton brought further understanding to the orbital motion of the planets, beyond the pure elliptical mathematics that Kepler described. As previously noted, Kepler didn't fully understand why the planets moved as they did, and only postulated the existence of forces acting upon them.</p>\n\n<p>Newton came to the conclusion that all objects in motion, whether it was the orbit of a moon or planet, or an apple falling from a tree, must follow the same principles.  Previous Aristotelian lines of thought had assigned different rules and types of motion to different things. Newton shifted the overall scientific perspective to unified patterns in nature.</p>\n\n<p>In his book, <em>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em> (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\", often simply referred to as <em>Principia</em>, pronounced with a hard-C, and published in 1687), Newton laid the foundations of classical mechanics, and proposed that all matter exerts a gravitational force that attracts matter toward its center. The strength of this force depends on the mass of the object, and weakens with distance.</p>\n\n<p>In a famous example, Newton created a thought experiment with the idea of climbing a tall mountain, above the atmosphere, and firing a cannon parallel to the ground.  He proposed that as the power of the shot increased, the cannonball would travel further with each shot, and that there would be a speed at which the trajectory of the cannonball would match the curvature of the planet, returning the shot to the point of origin. This would effectively create an orbit (diagram below).</p>\n\n<p>Newton's laws and equations worked so well, that they are still used today as classical mechanics, and the foundation of modern classical physics.</p>\n\n<p>Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation seemed to complete the entire picture of how objects move through space, and how gravity works. But this too was incomplete. Astronomers began to notice something odd about the planet Mercury.  Even after taking into account the influences of all of the other planets in the solar system, the orbit of Mercury seemed to precess (rotate) more than it should. This anomalous effect was measurable, and could not be explained away until a new, additional theory came along.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/newton-cannonball.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Precession of Perihelion of Mercury, and Einstein</strong></p>\n\n<p>Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation stood relatively unchallenged as the best theory of gravity for over two centuries. However, during the latter part of this period, a problem was noticed.</p>\n\n<p>Due to interactions between the planets, their orbits can precess over time (rotation of orientation of the orbit).  Newton's laws described this very well, for the most part. However, in 1859 Urbain Le Verrier discovered that the rate of precession for the planet Mercury disagreed with the predictions from Newton's theory. This anomalous precession lacked a good explanation for decades. Though many ideas were suggested, they all failed to hold up to scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the problem is that Newton's theory depended on the assumption that mass, distance, and time are constant regardless of where you observe them.</p>\n\n<p>Albert Einstein published his theories of Special Relativity in 1905 and General Relativity in 1915, which proposed a deeper underlying reality in which time, space, and mass are much more fluid, and depend on the frame of reference in which you measure them. Newton's theory is still mostly true within a single frame of reference, and on small scales and at low speeds where the differences from Einstein's system are negligible. However objects in orbit have independent reference frames, and Mercury is in a particularly fast orbit, deep within the sun's gravity well.</p>\n\n<p>This new theory described a system in which space and time (together referred to as spacetime) can be distorted by the presence of matter and energy. Time is flexible, and runs slower in places that are deeper within gravitational fields. With the curvature of spacetime mediating the gravitation between the sun and Mercury, whose orbit is very close, the remaining anomalous precession could now be easily explained.  </p>\n\n<p>Einstein was aware of this problem in astronomy, and in his paper he proposed three separate tests that could be performed to prove his theory, and included Mercury's precession as one of them.  In fact, it was soon demonstrated that his theory's predictions matched very closely with observed measurements, which cemented General Relativity as something to be taken seriously, and it remains the currently accepted theory of gravity.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that only at extreme speeds or scales will Einstein's relativistic effects be noticed.  Even with Mercury's orbit, the effects were subtle, and required precise measurements to be detectable. Newton's and Kepler's mathematical models work so well within the scale of the solar system that they are still used to launch satellites and other spacecraft to destinations throughout, and predict their motion.  For this reason Einstein's theories often are not seen as a replacement, but rather a more complete realization of the same physical laws.</p>\n\n<p>And this brings us full circle, to why I wanted to use a Mercury-like planet in a tight, fast orbit for my circumnavigation! ;) :D</p>\n\n<p>This of course was a very superficial historical look at the development of an understanding of gravity and planetary orbits. If you're interested in more detail, there's certainly a wealth of information online about these subjects. We've only just scratched the surface, of course.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/mercury-precession2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://screenshots.orvidius.com/EliteDangerous/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/ForumImages/Relativistic_precession.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>end of line</strong></p>\n\n","solDistance":7547.35,"id64":347591185786,"rating":3.57,"curation":5.5,"avgStars":2.5,"votes":14,"poiUrl":"https://edastro.com/gec/view/72","mainImage":"https://orvidius.com/screenshots/Exploration/Circumnavigation01/2018-10-08%2002-25-38%20Smojeia%20LI-E%20c14-1.jpg","callsign":null,"latitude":-0.0275,"longitude":70.9331,"rare":false,"source":"GEC"},{"id":73,"type":"Planetary Features","type2":"","categoryId":4,"categoryId2":0,"name":"Via Gravitatis","region":"Inner Orion Spur","galMapSearch":"KOI 1701","galMapUrl":"https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/68741857/name/KOI+1701","coordinates":[-5931.06,887.75,1361.28],"summary":"A very high gravity landable planet, over 45 G.","descriptionMardown":"Discovered during a survey of previously unrecorded KOI catalogue systems, Via Gravitatis (KOI 1701 A) is Currently the record highest gravity for a landable planet, as of September 6, 3307.

It is a variable star, its brightness fluctuating by 0.1% over the course of 11 years. Sol isn't as active as other stars in its class, which might have helped life to arise and flourish on Earth over billions of years.\r\n\r\n**Mercury**\r\n![Sol I](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383801552314469/Sol_20221005-132601.png)\r\n\r\nMercury is the innermost of the major planets, and the smallest one. It completes one orbit in just under 88 days, and is tidally locked into a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance with Sol, rotating 3 times during every 2 orbits it completes. Its namesake comes from the Roman god *Mercurius*, messenger of the gods, for this planet moves the faster in the night sky than any other planet does. \r\nSince there is no substantial atmosphere here, Mercury experiences wild temperature shifts between its day and night side, the highest reaching 700 K (427 °C), while the lowest can be around 53 K (-220 °C).\r\n\r\n**Venus**\r\n![Sol II](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383802093387907/Sol_20221005-132958.png)\r\n\r\nVenus is the second planet in the Solar System, and the hottest one. Its surface is obscured by a thick layer of sulfuric acid clouds, which are highly reflective, making it the brightest planet seen from Earth. This is why it was named after *Venus*, the Roman goddess of beauty and love. \r\nThe planet has undergone a runaway greenhouse effect, trapping heat within its carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere. As a result, despite being farther from the Sun than Mercury is, temperatures around Venus are even hotter than the first planet's, with the average being a staggering 737 K (464 °C), while the atmosphere is much thicker: it has a surface pressure of 92 atm. \r\nVenus rotates backwards compared to the other planets, its rotation period being -243 days. This actually makes its rotation period longer than its sidereal orbital period, which is 224 days.\r\n\r\n**Earth**\r\n![Sol III](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383802533781545/Sol_20221005-133750.png)\r\n\r\nEarth is the third planet from Sol, and the largest of the terrestrial planets. Life began here around 4 billion years ago, evolving from simple self-replicating cells to complex intelligent life. Life on Earth changed the composition of Earth's atmosphere over time, producing substantial amounts of Oxygen through photosynthesis once cyanobacteria appeared, as well as Ozone. This, in tandem with the planet's strong magnetic field, protects its surface from harmful radiation from Sol and other cosmic sources. \r\nThe first modern humans came about on the continent of Africa some 300,000 years ago, becoming the dominant species on the planet not long after. Humans further developed their societies through farms and towns to major cities and countries, eventually accomplishing space travel. Humans first set foot on the surface of another celestial body, the Moon, in 1969.\r\n\r\n**The Moon**\r\n![Earth I](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027391514776719432/luna.png)\r\n\r\nThe Moon (or less commonly \"Luna\") is Earth's sole natural satellite. It is theorised to have formed from a major planetary collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body named Theia. This event gave Earth its current axial tilt. Over time, the debris from the impact coalesced into a sphere and began to cool. While during these early times, the Moon had plenty of volcanic activity, this cooling eventually, stopped its volcanism entirely. The vast lunar basalt plains called \"seas\" (*mare*) are evidence of this past volcanic activity.\r\nThe Moon is tidally locked to Earth, its rotational period being the same as its orbital period. This movement through the sky, visible as different \"phases\" from the Earth's surface, inspired what are now the months of the year, a month being about the same length as the Moon's orbital period.\r\n\r\nThe Moon is thought to be a major factor in the development of life, as its gravitational force caused tides on a rapidly-rotating Earth, pulling its liquid oceans back and forth, and thus slowing its rotation. It also stabilizes the planet's axial tilt, making the lengths of the seasons consistent. Some life forms even evolved to recognize and rely on the light of the Moon at night, such as newly hatched sea turtles, which use moonlight to find their way out to the ocean.\r\n\r\n**Mars**\r\n![Sol IV](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383802982580254/Sol_20221005-134330.png)\r\n\r\nMars is the fourth planet from Sol, and is the first ever planet to have been successfully terraformed, in 2291. Early in the third millenium, the capital of the Federation has moved from Earth to Mars.\r\nIn ancient times, this planet was particularly fascinating to humans because of its visually distinct red color in the sky. This is why it was named after *Mars*, the Roman god of war.\r\nThe planet has a similar axial tilt to Earth at 25.19°. Humans first set foot here in the 2070s, and later on in the 2100s, ancient fossils were uncovered, providing clear evidence that life once existed there. The iron oxide left over from before the terraforming remains on the surface, still giving the planet a red hue from space.\r\n\r\n**Jupiter**\r\n![Sol V](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383803351679046/Sol_20221005-135124.png)\r\n\r\nJupiter is the fifth planet from Sol and the largest in the system. It is a Class I Gas Giant and has more than twice the mass of all the other planets combined. From Earth, it is the third brightest natural object in the night sky, after the Moon and Venus. Its namesake is derived from the Roman god *Jupiter*, the king of the gods. \r\nOut of all the planets, Jupiter is believed to be the oldest, and is composed of 73.7% Hydrogen and 26.3% Helium. It completes a rotation in 9 hours and 55 minutes, and this high rotational speed is what causes the planet's equatorial bulge. The planet's surface cloud layers have an abundance of stripes and storms, but the most notable of which is known as the \"Great Red Spot\", an enormous storm that has persisted since at least the year 1665.\r\n\r\n**The Galilean Moons**\r\n![Galilean Moons](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027619731370422442/galileanmoons.png)\r\n\r\nThese 4 moons are known as the *Galilean Moons* after the astronomer who discovered them in the early 17th century, Galileo Galilei. These natural satellites were the first objects found to be orbiting a body other than the Earth. Their names come from the lovers of the Greek god *Zeus*, who is the equivalent to Jupiter. These moons are special in their own right: the third moon from Jupiter, Ganymede, is the largest moon in the Solar System, and its diameter greater than that of Mercury, but it's not nearly as massive as the planet. Europa has a subsurface ocean caused by tidal heating between it and Jupiter. Io, Europa and Ganymede are locked in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance. \r\n\r\nGalileo's discovery proved that the belief of his time that everything in the sky revolved around the Earth was false: everything revolved around the Sun instead. He also developed a method to determine a person's longitude on Earth based on the predicted timings of eclipses from the moons onto Jupiter. This was actually a precursor to proving that the speed of light is not infinite, but light does in fact take measurable time to travel to its destination. \r\n\r\n**Saturn**\r\n![Sol VI](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383805461413938/Sol_20221005-140903.png)\r\n\r\nSaturn is the sixth planet from Sol, and the second largest planet in the Sol system. The Class I Gas Giant is famous for its distinctive ring system that has been discernible through even the earliest telescopes. Its namesake is the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. The progenitor for these rings is unknown, but it is thought that these rings are the remains of a moon that was torn apart by the giant's tidal forces. Based on data from Cassini, Saturn's rings are thought to be relatively young on the astronomical scale, having formed possibly within the last 100 million years. However it could also be that the rings are nearly as old as the planet itself, once holding a higher mass of material. Over time as the rings depleted, they evolved to be at the mass we currently measure. Saturn is eventually going to lose its rings in about 100 million years, so they are a temporary feature of the gas giant.\r\n\r\n**The Moons of Saturn**\r\n![Saturnian Moons](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027619731726938184/saturnianmoons.png)\r\n\r\nThe Moons of Saturn are fascinating in appearance, as well as in how they interact with one another along their orbits. The most well-known of these moons are Enceladus and Titan. Titan was the first to be discovered by Christian Huygens in 1655, while Tethys, Rhea, Iapetus and Dione were discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, and Enceladus was discovered in 1789 by William Herschel. \r\n\r\n*Enceladus* was the target of many scientific missions since the spacecraft Cassini studied it in close detail in the early 2000s. It is covered in fresh ice, as well as cratered regions, which distinctly separate younger and older regions. Major water vapor ejecta are shot from the moon's south polar regions, with enough velocity to escape the moon's surface gravity. Eventually these gases begin orbiting Saturn itself, forming Saturn's gaseous E ring.\r\n\r\n*Titan* is significant amongst all the moons in the Sol System, as it is the only moon discovered to have a thick atmosphere, not just tenuous gases. It is mostly composed of Nitrogen, with a small percentage of Methane. Titan is also the second largest natural satellite in the Sol System after Ganymede, and it too has a diameter greater than that of Mercury. However, just like the other moon, it is only 40% as massive as the planet. Titan is also the second body ever discovered after the Earth to have stable liquids on its surface, although it's not water: rather, at these cold temperatures (94 K), it is liquid methane instead.\r\n\r\n*Iapetus* has a visually striking surface, with one hemisphere being much brighter than the other. These two hemispheres make its appearance from Earth change in apparent magnitude depending on what side is facing Earth as the moon orbits Saturn. As the moon is tidally locked, the two hemispheres consistently show up in the same places. This led to them being labeled as the bright hemisphere when the moon was to the West, and the dark hemisphere when the moon was to the East of Saturn. The discoverer, Cassini, correctly identified this in the 1700s.\r\n\r\n**Uranus**\r\n![Sol VII](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383874180886548/Sol_20221005-142657.png)\r\n\r\nUranus is the seventh planet from Sol, and the largest and least massive of the Ice Giants. Although it is actually visible with the naked eye in sufficiently dark skies, ancient astronomers didn't recognize it as a planet. They thought it was a star, because of its slow orbital velocity meant that the planet didn't travel visibly in the night sky nearly as much as the classical planets did. (After all, the term likely comes from the Greek word planḗtai, which means wanderers, travellers.) The English namesake for this planet and its moons are different than the other planets, as the planet's name *Uranus* is the Greek god of the sky, whereas the others are named after Roman gods. Uranus was discovered by William Herschel on the 13th of March, 1781. \r\nThe planet has a significant obliquity, its tilt being 97.7° to its orbit. This means that the planet, as well as the rest of the Uranian moon system, rotate near perpendicularly to its orbital plane. The planet also has a thin ring system, a fact that was discovered on accident when the rings began to occult the star HD 128598, making the star disappear a few times before Uranus did.\r\n\r\n**Moons of Uranus**\r\n![UranianMoons](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027619732171522138/uranianmoons.png)\r\n\r\nThe moons of Uranus are named after the queen and king of faeries in medieval and renaissance literature, mostly known from the characters in the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Herschel discovered Titania and Oberon six years after the discovery of Uranus, and in 1851, Ariel and Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell. Miranda was found in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper, and the other moons were discovered either by the flyby of Voyager 2, or through other advanced Earth-based telescopes.\r\n\r\n**Neptune**\r\n![Sol VIII](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383968405917726/Sol_20221005-144152.png)\r\n\r\nNeptune is the eighth planet from Sol, and the smallest and most massive of the Ice Giants. The planet's namesake comes from *Neptune*, the Roman god of the sea. Unlike the planets before it, Neptune is not visible to the naked eye. It was the first planet to be found using mathematical prediction instead of direct observation. The observed orbit of Uranus did not follow its mathematically calculated orbit well enough, which led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesize that there must be another planet beyond Uranus that perturbs it. Urbain Le Verrier calculated where this hypothetical planet might be, and Johann Galle eventually found it within a degree of where Le Verrier predicted it would be. The planet has a very faint ring system, the first of which was discovered in 1968 by Edward Guinan.\r\n\r\n**Triton**\r\n![Triton](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383968829546517/Sol_20221005-144405.png)\r\n\r\nTriton is a peculiar moon in the Sol System, as it orbits Neptune in retrograde, and its orbit is also inclined 129° to the ecliptic - and yet, its eccentricity is only 0.000016. It is thought to be a captured dwarf planet from the nearby Kuiper Belt. It is the seventh largest moon in the Sol System. \r\nFor reasons unknown, Triton is permit locked by the Pilot's Federation, and no ships are currently allowed to land there.\r\n\r\n**The Trans-Neptunian Dwarf Planets**\r\n![dwarfs](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027588575090454560/dwarf_planets.png)\r\n\r\nThe Trans-Neptunian Dwarf Planets are small planetary bodies in the outer reaches of the Solar System, beyond Neptune's orbit. The IAU does not classify these bodies as \"regular\" planets, as they have not cleared their surrounding neighborhood of matter. They are found mostly in a region beyond the orbit of Neptune, populated by many small icy bodies called the Kuiper Belt.\r\nThese bodies might have differentiated interiors. Their masses were originally found by studying the orbital period of the dwarf planet's moon, if one existed. Their diameters were also originally found by studying the occultations of background stars, when the body briefly passes in front of a star.\r\n\r\n*Pluto* and *Charon* make up a double dwarf planet system in the Kuiper Belt. They were discovered by Clyde W. Tombaugh on February 18, 1930, and Charon was discovered to be a separate body much later, in 1978, by James Christy. At the time of Pluto's discovery, astronomers insisted that Uranus' perturbed orbit could not be explained just by Neptune alone, so they kept searching for the so-called \"Planet X\". Tombaugh was using a blink comparator to search for small movements in certain night sky pictures when he found Pluto and Charon. \r\n\r\nThe Pluto-Charon barycentre is in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. In fact, when viewing the entire solar system from above, Pluto's orbit appears to overtake Neptune's, being closer to the Sun than it. However, Pluto's orbit is inclined as such that its orbital path takes it 8 AU above Neptune's.\r\n\r\n*Eris* is the second largest dwarf planet and the most massive, being heavier than Pluto is. It was discovered in 2005 from images taken two years earlier. Because it is heavier than Pluto, and at first appeared larger than it, after its discovery the IAU at first named it as the tenth planet of the Solar system. However, as more and more such Trans-Neptunian Objects were discovered (their discovered numbers reached into the thousands by the 2020s), after much debate the union adopted a new formal definition of dwarf planets, which meant that Eris was no longer considered the tenth planet.\r\nEris has an orbital period of 559 days, and is inclined from the ecliptic by 44°. It is the second brightest large body by albedo at 0.96, only being surpassed by Enceladus.\r\n\r\n*Haumea* is the third largest dwarf planet behind Eris and Pluto, and was discovered in 2004. It completes one day in just under four hours, and has transformed into a triaxial ellipsoid as a result. This is expected as the body shows clear color variations as it rotates, a fast rotation period being the only logical explanation.\r\n\r\n*Orcus* is the eighth largest dwarf planet and has one moon, *Vanth*. Orcus was discovered in 2004, Vanth a year later. The body is in a 2:3 orbit resonance with Neptune, just like Pluto. Orcus has earned the nickname \"Anti-Pluto\" because of similarities in their orbital periods, inclinations and eccentricities, and it also has a large satellite.\r\n\r\n*Sedna* is a dwarf planet in the outer solar system, one of the most far away we know of. It was discovered in 2003.  Its closest approach to Sol only brings it to a distance of 76.2 AU, and its aphelion goes out to around 937 AU, a full orbit taking approximately 11,400 years. Its eccentricity is 0.8496. Sedna's surface is dotted by red regions, tholins caused by the breakdown of carbon compounds by Sol's ultraviolet light.\r\n\r\n*Salacia* was discovered in 2004 and has a single moon, Actaea. The moon orbits Salacia in 5.5 days. The planet has a very low albedo of 0.04, making its surface barely distinguishable from the blackness of space. \r\n\r\n*Quaoar* was discovered in 2002 and takes 288 years to orbit Sol. It completes one full day in 8.8 hours, causing it to form the shape of an oblate spheroid, much like that of Earth.\r\n\r\n*2002 MS4* is a Kuiper Belt object discovered in 2002. As it is currently passing through a dense star field, multiple stellar occultations were used to determine its diameter, which is 500 miles (800km). It is the largest unnamed object in the system.\r\n\r\n*2007 OR10* is a Scattered Disc body that completes a full orbit in 554 years, the third longest of all dwarf planets. In 2009 the Minor Planet Center assigned the name *Gonggong* to this body.\r\n\r\n*Makemake* is a reddish Kuiper Belt object discovered in 2005. It takes 306 years to complete one orbit. Its orbit is inclined to 29°.\r\n\r\n**Persephone**\r\n![Sol IX](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027391515204534332/persephone.png)\r\n\r\nPersephone is a dark and icy body nearly 10 times the mass of the Earth on a very long orbit around the Sun, taking 20,000 years to complete one orbit. It was first hypothesized to exist from apparent perturbations in the eccentric orbits of very distant Kuiper Belt objects. Throughout its search it was tagged as \"Planet Nine\". Astronomers correctly predicted that something was shepherding these bodies into peculiar orbits, for example the large perihelion of Sedna. It also explained why objects in near-perpendicular orbits have big semi-major axes. This is the second planet whose existence was discovered by orbital perturbation.","descriptionHtml":"<p>The Solar System is composed of a single G type star, being orbited by 9 major planets and 11 other dwarf planets.

It is a variable star, its brightness fluctuating by 0.1% over the course of 11 years. Sol isn't as active as other stars in its class, which might have helped life to arise and flourish on Earth over billions of years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mercury</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383801552314469/Sol_20221005-132601.png\" alt=\"Sol I\" /></p>\n\n<p>Mercury is the innermost of the major planets, and the smallest one. It completes one orbit in just under 88 days, and is tidally locked into a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance with Sol, rotating 3 times during every 2 orbits it completes. Its namesake comes from the Roman god <em>Mercurius</em>, messenger of the gods, for this planet moves the faster in the night sky than any other planet does. \nSince there is no substantial atmosphere here, Mercury experiences wild temperature shifts between its day and night side, the highest reaching 700 K (427 °C), while the lowest can be around 53 K (-220 °C).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Venus</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383802093387907/Sol_20221005-132958.png\" alt=\"Sol II\" /></p>\n\n<p>Venus is the second planet in the Solar System, and the hottest one. Its surface is obscured by a thick layer of sulfuric acid clouds, which are highly reflective, making it the brightest planet seen from Earth. This is why it was named after <em>Venus</em>, the Roman goddess of beauty and love. \nThe planet has undergone a runaway greenhouse effect, trapping heat within its carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere. As a result, despite being farther from the Sun than Mercury is, temperatures around Venus are even hotter than the first planet's, with the average being a staggering 737 K (464 °C), while the atmosphere is much thicker: it has a surface pressure of 92 atm. \nVenus rotates backwards compared to the other planets, its rotation period being -243 days. This actually makes its rotation period longer than its sidereal orbital period, which is 224 days.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Earth</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383802533781545/Sol_20221005-133750.png\" alt=\"Sol III\" /></p>\n\n<p>Earth is the third planet from Sol, and the largest of the terrestrial planets. Life began here around 4 billion years ago, evolving from simple self-replicating cells to complex intelligent life. Life on Earth changed the composition of Earth's atmosphere over time, producing substantial amounts of Oxygen through photosynthesis once cyanobacteria appeared, as well as Ozone. This, in tandem with the planet's strong magnetic field, protects its surface from harmful radiation from Sol and other cosmic sources. \nThe first modern humans came about on the continent of Africa some 300,000 years ago, becoming the dominant species on the planet not long after. Humans further developed their societies through farms and towns to major cities and countries, eventually accomplishing space travel. Humans first set foot on the surface of another celestial body, the Moon, in 1969.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Moon</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027391514776719432/luna.png\" alt=\"Earth I\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Moon (or less commonly \"Luna\") is Earth's sole natural satellite. It is theorised to have formed from a major planetary collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body named Theia. This event gave Earth its current axial tilt. Over time, the debris from the impact coalesced into a sphere and began to cool. While during these early times, the Moon had plenty of volcanic activity, this cooling eventually, stopped its volcanism entirely. The vast lunar basalt plains called \"seas\" (<em>mare</em>) are evidence of this past volcanic activity.<br/>\nThe Moon is tidally locked to Earth, its rotational period being the same as its orbital period. This movement through the sky, visible as different \"phases\" from the Earth's surface, inspired what are now the months of the year, a month being about the same length as the Moon's orbital period.</p>\n\n<p>The Moon is thought to be a major factor in the development of life, as its gravitational force caused tides on a rapidly-rotating Earth, pulling its liquid oceans back and forth, and thus slowing its rotation. It also stabilizes the planet's axial tilt, making the lengths of the seasons consistent. Some life forms even evolved to recognize and rely on the light of the Moon at night, such as newly hatched sea turtles, which use moonlight to find their way out to the ocean.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mars</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383802982580254/Sol_20221005-134330.png\" alt=\"Sol IV\" /></p>\n\n<p>Mars is the fourth planet from Sol, and is the first ever planet to have been successfully terraformed, in 2291. Early in the third millenium, the capital of the Federation has moved from Earth to Mars.<br/>\nIn ancient times, this planet was particularly fascinating to humans because of its visually distinct red color in the sky. This is why it was named after <em>Mars</em>, the Roman god of war.<br/>\nThe planet has a similar axial tilt to Earth at 25.19°. Humans first set foot here in the 2070s, and later on in the 2100s, ancient fossils were uncovered, providing clear evidence that life once existed there. The iron oxide left over from before the terraforming remains on the surface, still giving the planet a red hue from space.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jupiter</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383803351679046/Sol_20221005-135124.png\" alt=\"Sol V\" /></p>\n\n<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from Sol and the largest in the system. It is a Class I Gas Giant and has more than twice the mass of all the other planets combined. From Earth, it is the third brightest natural object in the night sky, after the Moon and Venus. Its namesake is derived from the Roman god <em>Jupiter</em>, the king of the gods. \nOut of all the planets, Jupiter is believed to be the oldest, and is composed of 73.7% Hydrogen and 26.3% Helium. It completes a rotation in 9 hours and 55 minutes, and this high rotational speed is what causes the planet's equatorial bulge. The planet's surface cloud layers have an abundance of stripes and storms, but the most notable of which is known as the \"Great Red Spot\", an enormous storm that has persisted since at least the year 1665.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Galilean Moons</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027619731370422442/galileanmoons.png\" alt=\"Galilean Moons\" /></p>\n\n<p>These 4 moons are known as the <em>Galilean Moons</em> after the astronomer who discovered them in the early 17th century, Galileo Galilei. These natural satellites were the first objects found to be orbiting a body other than the Earth. Their names come from the lovers of the Greek god <em>Zeus</em>, who is the equivalent to Jupiter. These moons are special in their own right: the third moon from Jupiter, Ganymede, is the largest moon in the Solar System, and its diameter greater than that of Mercury, but it's not nearly as massive as the planet. Europa has a subsurface ocean caused by tidal heating between it and Jupiter. Io, Europa and Ganymede are locked in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance. </p>\n\n<p>Galileo's discovery proved that the belief of his time that everything in the sky revolved around the Earth was false: everything revolved around the Sun instead. He also developed a method to determine a person's longitude on Earth based on the predicted timings of eclipses from the moons onto Jupiter. This was actually a precursor to proving that the speed of light is not infinite, but light does in fact take measurable time to travel to its destination. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Saturn</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383805461413938/Sol_20221005-140903.png\" alt=\"Sol VI\" /></p>\n\n<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from Sol, and the second largest planet in the Sol system. The Class I Gas Giant is famous for its distinctive ring system that has been discernible through even the earliest telescopes. Its namesake is the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. The progenitor for these rings is unknown, but it is thought that these rings are the remains of a moon that was torn apart by the giant's tidal forces. Based on data from Cassini, Saturn's rings are thought to be relatively young on the astronomical scale, having formed possibly within the last 100 million years. However it could also be that the rings are nearly as old as the planet itself, once holding a higher mass of material. Over time as the rings depleted, they evolved to be at the mass we currently measure. Saturn is eventually going to lose its rings in about 100 million years, so they are a temporary feature of the gas giant.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Moons of Saturn</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027619731726938184/saturnianmoons.png\" alt=\"Saturnian Moons\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Moons of Saturn are fascinating in appearance, as well as in how they interact with one another along their orbits. The most well-known of these moons are Enceladus and Titan. Titan was the first to be discovered by Christian Huygens in 1655, while Tethys, Rhea, Iapetus and Dione were discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, and Enceladus was discovered in 1789 by William Herschel. </p>\n\n<p><em>Enceladus</em> was the target of many scientific missions since the spacecraft Cassini studied it in close detail in the early 2000s. It is covered in fresh ice, as well as cratered regions, which distinctly separate younger and older regions. Major water vapor ejecta are shot from the moon's south polar regions, with enough velocity to escape the moon's surface gravity. Eventually these gases begin orbiting Saturn itself, forming Saturn's gaseous E ring.</p>\n\n<p><em>Titan</em> is significant amongst all the moons in the Sol System, as it is the only moon discovered to have a thick atmosphere, not just tenuous gases. It is mostly composed of Nitrogen, with a small percentage of Methane. Titan is also the second largest natural satellite in the Sol System after Ganymede, and it too has a diameter greater than that of Mercury. However, just like the other moon, it is only 40% as massive as the planet. Titan is also the second body ever discovered after the Earth to have stable liquids on its surface, although it's not water: rather, at these cold temperatures (94 K), it is liquid methane instead.</p>\n\n<p><em>Iapetus</em> has a visually striking surface, with one hemisphere being much brighter than the other. These two hemispheres make its appearance from Earth change in apparent magnitude depending on what side is facing Earth as the moon orbits Saturn. As the moon is tidally locked, the two hemispheres consistently show up in the same places. This led to them being labeled as the bright hemisphere when the moon was to the West, and the dark hemisphere when the moon was to the East of Saturn. The discoverer, Cassini, correctly identified this in the 1700s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Uranus</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383874180886548/Sol_20221005-142657.png\" alt=\"Sol VII\" /></p>\n\n<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from Sol, and the largest and least massive of the Ice Giants. Although it is actually visible with the naked eye in sufficiently dark skies, ancient astronomers didn't recognize it as a planet. They thought it was a star, because of its slow orbital velocity meant that the planet didn't travel visibly in the night sky nearly as much as the classical planets did. (After all, the term likely comes from the Greek word planḗtai, which means wanderers, travellers.) The English namesake for this planet and its moons are different than the other planets, as the planet's name <em>Uranus</em> is the Greek god of the sky, whereas the others are named after Roman gods. Uranus was discovered by William Herschel on the 13th of March, 1781. \nThe planet has a significant obliquity, its tilt being 97.7° to its orbit. This means that the planet, as well as the rest of the Uranian moon system, rotate near perpendicularly to its orbital plane. The planet also has a thin ring system, a fact that was discovered on accident when the rings began to occult the star HD 128598, making the star disappear a few times before Uranus did.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Moons of Uranus</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027619732171522138/uranianmoons.png\" alt=\"UranianMoons\" /></p>\n\n<p>The moons of Uranus are named after the queen and king of faeries in medieval and renaissance literature, mostly known from the characters in the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Herschel discovered Titania and Oberon six years after the discovery of Uranus, and in 1851, Ariel and Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell. Miranda was found in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper, and the other moons were discovered either by the flyby of Voyager 2, or through other advanced Earth-based telescopes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Neptune</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383968405917726/Sol_20221005-144152.png\" alt=\"Sol VIII\" /></p>\n\n<p>Neptune is the eighth planet from Sol, and the smallest and most massive of the Ice Giants. The planet's namesake comes from <em>Neptune</em>, the Roman god of the sea. Unlike the planets before it, Neptune is not visible to the naked eye. It was the first planet to be found using mathematical prediction instead of direct observation. The observed orbit of Uranus did not follow its mathematically calculated orbit well enough, which led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesize that there must be another planet beyond Uranus that perturbs it. Urbain Le Verrier calculated where this hypothetical planet might be, and Johann Galle eventually found it within a degree of where Le Verrier predicted it would be. The planet has a very faint ring system, the first of which was discovered in 1968 by Edward Guinan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Triton</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027383968829546517/Sol_20221005-144405.png\" alt=\"Triton\" /></p>\n\n<p>Triton is a peculiar moon in the Sol System, as it orbits Neptune in retrograde, and its orbit is also inclined 129° to the ecliptic - and yet, its eccentricity is only 0.000016. It is thought to be a captured dwarf planet from the nearby Kuiper Belt. It is the seventh largest moon in the Sol System. \nFor reasons unknown, Triton is permit locked by the Pilot's Federation, and no ships are currently allowed to land there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Trans-Neptunian Dwarf Planets</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027588575090454560/dwarf_planets.png\" alt=\"dwarfs\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Trans-Neptunian Dwarf Planets are small planetary bodies in the outer reaches of the Solar System, beyond Neptune's orbit. The IAU does not classify these bodies as \"regular\" planets, as they have not cleared their surrounding neighborhood of matter. They are found mostly in a region beyond the orbit of Neptune, populated by many small icy bodies called the Kuiper Belt.<br/>\nThese bodies might have differentiated interiors. Their masses were originally found by studying the orbital period of the dwarf planet's moon, if one existed. Their diameters were also originally found by studying the occultations of background stars, when the body briefly passes in front of a star.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pluto</em> and <em>Charon</em> make up a double dwarf planet system in the Kuiper Belt. They were discovered by Clyde W. Tombaugh on February 18, 1930, and Charon was discovered to be a separate body much later, in 1978, by James Christy. At the time of Pluto's discovery, astronomers insisted that Uranus' perturbed orbit could not be explained just by Neptune alone, so they kept searching for the so-called \"Planet X\". Tombaugh was using a blink comparator to search for small movements in certain night sky pictures when he found Pluto and Charon. </p>\n\n<p>The Pluto-Charon barycentre is in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. In fact, when viewing the entire solar system from above, Pluto's orbit appears to overtake Neptune's, being closer to the Sun than it. However, Pluto's orbit is inclined as such that its orbital path takes it 8 AU above Neptune's.</p>\n\n<p><em>Eris</em> is the second largest dwarf planet and the most massive, being heavier than Pluto is. It was discovered in 2005 from images taken two years earlier. Because it is heavier than Pluto, and at first appeared larger than it, after its discovery the IAU at first named it as the tenth planet of the Solar system. However, as more and more such Trans-Neptunian Objects were discovered (their discovered numbers reached into the thousands by the 2020s), after much debate the union adopted a new formal definition of dwarf planets, which meant that Eris was no longer considered the tenth planet.<br/>\nEris has an orbital period of 559 days, and is inclined from the ecliptic by 44°. It is the second brightest large body by albedo at 0.96, only being surpassed by Enceladus.</p>\n\n<p><em>Haumea</em> is the third largest dwarf planet behind Eris and Pluto, and was discovered in 2004. It completes one day in just under four hours, and has transformed into a triaxial ellipsoid as a result. This is expected as the body shows clear color variations as it rotates, a fast rotation period being the only logical explanation.</p>\n\n<p><em>Orcus</em> is the eighth largest dwarf planet and has one moon, <em>Vanth</em>. Orcus was discovered in 2004, Vanth a year later. The body is in a 2:3 orbit resonance with Neptune, just like Pluto. Orcus has earned the nickname \"Anti-Pluto\" because of similarities in their orbital periods, inclinations and eccentricities, and it also has a large satellite.</p>\n\n<p><em>Sedna</em> is a dwarf planet in the outer solar system, one of the most far away we know of. It was discovered in 2003.  Its closest approach to Sol only brings it to a distance of 76.2 AU, and its aphelion goes out to around 937 AU, a full orbit taking approximately 11,400 years. Its eccentricity is 0.8496. Sedna's surface is dotted by red regions, tholins caused by the breakdown of carbon compounds by Sol's ultraviolet light.</p>\n\n<p><em>Salacia</em> was discovered in 2004 and has a single moon, Actaea. The moon orbits Salacia in 5.5 days. The planet has a very low albedo of 0.04, making its surface barely distinguishable from the blackness of space. </p>\n\n<p><em>Quaoar</em> was discovered in 2002 and takes 288 years to orbit Sol. It completes one full day in 8.8 hours, causing it to form the shape of an oblate spheroid, much like that of Earth.</p>\n\n<p><em>2002 MS4</em> is a Kuiper Belt object discovered in 2002. As it is currently passing through a dense star field, multiple stellar occultations were used to determine its diameter, which is 500 miles (800km). It is the largest unnamed object in the system.</p>\n\n<p><em>2007 OR10</em> is a Scattered Disc body that completes a full orbit in 554 years, the third longest of all dwarf planets. In 2009 the Minor Planet Center assigned the name <em>Gonggong</em> to this body.</p>\n\n<p><em>Makemake</em> is a reddish Kuiper Belt object discovered in 2005. It takes 306 years to complete one orbit. Its orbit is inclined to 29°.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Persephone</strong>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027391515204534332/persephone.png\" alt=\"Sol IX\" /></p>\n\n<p>Persephone is a dark and icy body nearly 10 times the mass of the Earth on a very long orbit around the Sun, taking 20,000 years to complete one orbit. It was first hypothesized to exist from apparent perturbations in the eccentric orbits of very distant Kuiper Belt objects. Throughout its search it was tagged as \"Planet Nine\". Astronomers correctly predicted that something was shepherding these bodies into peculiar orbits, for example the large perihelion of Sedna. It also explained why objects in near-perpendicular orbits have big semi-major axes. This is the second planet whose existence was discovered by orbital perturbation.</p>\n\n","solDistance":0,"id64":10477373803,"rating":6.87,"curation":8.88,"avgStars":4.75,"votes":8,"poiUrl":"https://edastro.com/gec/view/254","mainImage":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/943630619680862290/1027588575509884968/solcropped.png","callsign":null,"rare":false,"source":"GEC"},{"id":255,"type":"Planetary Features","type2":"","categoryId":4,"categoryId2":0,"name":"Mordor Ice Rally Circuit","region":"Inner Orion Spur","galMapSearch":"Traikeou KB-X b18-0","galMapUrl":"https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/76654728/name/Traikeou+KB-X+b18-0","coordinates":[-6783.28,644.594,4467.12],"summary":"Located on the A 2 a moon, this is a natural formation that's enclosed by walls which are 2 km high, making it an ideal racing circuit.","descriptionMardown":"Located in the *Traikeou KB-X b18-0* system, on the *A 2 a* icy moon, is a rare geological formation: towering walls, which reach 2 km in height, fully surround a larger area.\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cDZNxtK.jpg)\r\n\r\nAlthough it might look like a fortress from the distance, this site was not built by anyone, it is a natural formation - though how exactly it came to be remains a mystery.

The parent moon in turn orbits a class III gas giant, and this arrangement can make an interesting „row“ vista of three heavenly bodies at appropriate times. <em>AB 1 b a</em> also has volcanic activity, silicate vapour geysers, which as of October 31st 3308 still need analysis.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/R3npLTQ/Iwhophs-UJ-R-e4-2-20221031-184307.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/vj5HHNQ/Iwhophs-UJ-R-e4-2-20221031-190520.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/GcCh0mX/Iwhophs-UJ-R-e4-2-20221031-185018-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Another fascinating feature is a landable planet (<em>C 1</em>) orbiting the 31 solar radii red giant at a mere 240 ls (approximately half of the Earth - Sol distance), making it little more than a metal-rich baked potato. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Jtgb0Yp/Iwhophs-UJ-R-e4-2-20221031-194539-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/ZhGSBhp/Iwhophs-UJ-R-e4-2-20221031-191922.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>The surface gravity of 1.4 g is above Earth average, but the surface isn’t too rough, so driving shouldn't be a problem.

In a way, everything above 2,600 ly in this area is a microcosm in its own right and definitely worth a visit.
